ACTIVITIES
Each person performed each of this six activities wearing a smartphone 
(Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING



MEASUREMENSTRS
The measurements were calculated based on the signals received from smartphone devices,
in particular from the accelerometer and gyroscope.

The signals that were used to calculates the measurements are:
3-axial linear acceleration :  X Y Z
3-axial angular velocity :  X Y Z
And therefore, '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

UNITS
Prefix 't' to denote time, and 'f' - frequency. 

Then mean values and standard deviation was calculated on top. 
mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation

As a result, the following data are included in the dataset as measurements.
